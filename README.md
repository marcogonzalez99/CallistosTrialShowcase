# 🌑 Callisto’s Trial

**Callisto’s Trial** is a brutal, atmospheric action roguelike set in a broken solar system lost to time. You are **Orion**, the sealed son of Callisto, chosen by the gods to face the Trial and uncover the truth of your bloodline — but not everything is as it seems.

Designed with purposefully difficult encounters, modular storytelling, and zero filler, the game draws inspiration from **Hades**, **Hyper Light Drifter**, and **Celeste**. Built in **PolarisKit**, it focuses on tight gameplay, handcrafted rooms, and elegant, symbolic progression.
